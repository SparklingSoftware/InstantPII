===== Reporting =====

Reporting is a very powerfull tool to drive the right behaviour. But you can also do a lot of damage if not used properly. It's very important to use reporting to a good use and to stimulate more improvements.

By simply reporting on the absolute number without the story behind the numbers is likely to make things worse.
