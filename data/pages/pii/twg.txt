===== Technical Working Group (TWG) =====

A technical working group is the only exception to the “No funded” world. In order to increase the speed of delivery of improvements, management in the form of the Management Steering Group (MSG) can decide to create something called a Technical working Group.

This is simply a project to fully implement one specific improvement. The project has a project manager, deadlines, deliverables, etc.

This project has two lines of reporting:
  * MSG (Financial and progress reporting goes up to the MSG.)
  * SEPG (Deliverables are signed off by the SEPG.)
