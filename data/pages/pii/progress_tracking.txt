===== Progress Tracking =====

The progress tracking function enables the different group within the SPII to:
  * See who is working on what.
  * Useful during the SEPG Meeting to discuss future plans.
  * Assign tasks to each other.
  * Allow for reporting.

In general, only the SEPG members would be using the progress function.

As the improvements can jump from any status to any other status (they should follow the normal process flow, but there are exceptions), it's not a good idea to enforce a strict process flow.

Ideally the improvements are entered into the progress tracking tool directly so that the information in the progress tracking function is allways up to date without the need for synchronisation.

Following the normal [[:spii:processes|SPII Process]], there are the following status:
  * New
  * Screened
  * Backlog
  * In Analysis
  * In Progress
  * Awaiting Sign-off
  * Done

Improvements can be assigned to a (and only one) particular PIT in any of the statusses (Although they are less relavant in some). The reason is to have only one captain on a ship. So the PITs might need to work together on a particular initiative and one PIT might delegate some tasks to another, there is still only one responsible for the progress. A PIT is able to hand over an IP to another PIT, that's fine. This can happen when one PIT needs to do one piece of work and another the other bit. So half way through the improvement, ownership is handed over.

The SEPG members can move all Improvements. Because history is kept in most progress tracking tools, mistakes (or so called mistakes :-)) are easily reversed. This does require the SEPG Members to be able to login to the system.

As these statusses translate well into an Agile way of working, it's great to be able to show the improvements on a virtual card wall. With a virtual card wall, all improvements are represented as cards and are identifyable their name. It allows the user to virtually move the 
cards from one status to the other. This visual representation of the status and progress gives the user a very nice overview.

There is a risk of PITs taking too many improvements at once. It would be great if the progress tracking system can limit the number of improvements that are "In Progress", but if not, then it's up to the PITs to manually limit that number. There is a serious risk of having too many improvements "in flight" and not finishing any of them. By not having a full agenda, the PIT can also have some fun in implementing the improvements! Just talk about stuff that happens in their project/area/department... It is therefore OK to have many improvements in the backlog, even if they all fall into the same process area.

As the PIT members are volunteering and doing improvements alongside their normal work, they cannot commit to deadlines. Because of this, any tasks that are in progress cannot be held to deadlines themselves as well. It's all on best-effort basis.
