===== Collaboration in the Process Improvement Infrastructure =====

In order to achieve process improvements in stead of gaining a stale document library, many people need to be involved and whoever's involved to be able to have their voice heard. Furthermore, to make good progress and not have to re-iterate the same discussions this collaboration needs to be structured.

The information below gives an example of how to structure your improvement initiative to enable the above.

The suggested structure isn't new. It has been proposed by Carnegie Melon in the early Nineties. In fact, you might know an outcome of this structure is it's heavily used in CMMI initiatives!

==== Organisation ====

The proposed organisational structure looks like this:

{{:interaction_between_sepg_pit_msg_and_twg.png?600|PII Team interactions}}

As you can see, it involves the creation of so called Process Improvement Teams (PITs). Interestingly enough, they exist in many companies already. The positive nature of people makes them form small pockets of likeminded employees to try to improve their process area.

The Carnegie Melon guys and girls realised this and suggested to formalise them and create an overarching forum that consists of the leads of each of the PITs and is called Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG). The name might not be accurate of what you are trying to achieve (It is most likely going to cover more than just software engineering), but as it's used all over the literature it will be used as is throughout this wiki. Please fill in any name/abbreviation to specify your scope as you like. Keeping the name does mean instant buy-in from people who are familliar with it though!

This overarching forum instantly becomes a very powerfull body because of the following reasons:
  * They represent a big portion of the organisation which means that requests for funding will be taken seriously.
  * They can work non funded, hence cannot easily be shut down under polical power.
  * This group is resilliant to organisational change as it's cross hierarchy by nature.
  * A sign of maturity is when the it becomes a vocal group and is asked by management for advice.

Typically the SEPG meetings occur every 2 weeks with the PITs meeting in the alternate week. So that what's gets decided in the PIT meeting can be discussed by the SEPG in the next week.

PITs should idealy be between 4 and 12 people. An SEPG meeting with less than 4 should not be making decissions, while bigger than 10-15 gets really hard to manage and will drag on too long.

These PIT and SEPG meetings are all non funded. Upper management needs to agree that employees can spend a fraction of their time doing process improvements. The results of the process improvement initiative need to show the effectiveness of the time spend.

There is however a way to apply for funding and that's via something called the Management Steering Group (MSG). This forum is typically made up of senior masnagers, like CIO, CTO, SDLC Managers, etc. The MSG meets every quarter to go over the status and results and also allows the SEPG to present a Business Case for funding. Thwo interesging things happen in that event:
  * The business case needs to be well written and fact based.
  * The MSG doesn't have to go look for second opponions to validate the request. It has been submitted by a group that is represented by a big portion of the organisation.

Long story short: Depending on the track record of the SEPG, the MSG can decide on the business case pretty quickly.

If the MSG gives their tick of approval, the funding isn't going to be handed over to the PITs. In stead, a project is formed. This project is called Technical Working Group (TWG) and has all the features if a formal project, like a project manager, deliverables, deadlines, etc.

The TWG will be delivering to the SEPG (usually one PIT becomes the formal delivery point). This way, the SEPG becomes completely responsible for the results that come out of the money spend. If the TWG delivers according to specs, the organisation should see the benefits as described in the business case.

==== What's involved in process improvements ====

The core of making process improvements is to get everyone to agree on the best process. In order to get those agreements, many things need to happen:

  - [[:collaboration:collaboration#Everyone needs to understand each other's background|Everyone needs to understand each other's background]]
  - [[:collaboration:collaboration#Everyone needs to have access to the facts to base a decision on|Everyone needs to have access to the facts to base a decision on]]
  - [[:collaboration:collaboration#The agreement needs to be supported by other stable decisions|The agreement needs to be supported by other stable decisions]]
  - [[:collaboration:collaboration#The people involved need to be able to discuss the proposed|The people involved need to be able to discuss the proposed]]
  - [[:collaboration:collaboration#The people involved need to see how the agreement fits into the bigger picture|The people involved need to see how the agreement fits into the bigger picture]]
  - [[:collaboration:collaboration#It needs to solve a problem, remove a roadblock or seize an opportunity|It needs to solve a problem, remove a roadblock or seize an opportunity]]
  - [[:collaboration:collaboration#Document the decision thoroughly |Document the decisions thoroughly]]

==== Everyone needs to understand each other's background ====

In order to have informed conversations or debates, everyone needs to understand each other's background so that when someone makes a claim about priorities, the other participants can value the claim and understand why it's important. 

It also helps them weigh their own priorities against those of their colleagues and challenge their own or those from their peers.

To achieve this, the different roles, their tasks, etc. need to be defined so that everyone can understand their meaning. Especially those participants that are from other competencies.

This is harder than it seems and that's because every process area has their own set of abbreviations and language and people generally don't really care about other competencies.

==== Everyone needs to have access to the facts to base a decision on ====

Get as much facts as possible before jumping into action. An increase of facts results in a decrease is room for discussion. There is an exception to this in case of contradicting facts, but that might be an indication that the organisation is not mature enough or that you might be dealing with multiple root causes. In any case, if you cannot manage to get the facts needed for a healthy discussion about improvements, than you should ask yourself whether you are on the right track.



The facts can be achieved in several ways, for instance:

  * Metrics out of systems (Automated, manual, one-off)

  * Customer feedback

  * Root cause analysis of production incidents over a period in the past

  * Project self-assessments 

  * Process Analysis

  * Voting / Survey

  * etc



Everyone needs to have access to these facts, so no one will be tempted to game them. Openness and honesty are the most important aspects.

==== The agreement needs to be supported by other stable decisions ====

As one decisions builds on top of each other, starting with an instable base is setting yourself up for failure. Like building a house of cards, only put the next layer up on a firm base.

Keeping the history of decisions made is a big part of this. To prevent teams to go back to earlier decisions, it's important for people to be able to go back and look what led to the decisions. This approach also creates an open environment where everyone can challenge all decisions. 

==== The people involved need to be able to discuss the proposed ====

The team members need to be able to have discussions in order to reach agreements. If everyone is in the same location, a face to face meeting obviously works best. With geo located teams other means need to be used.



Different time zones make it even harder to reach agreements as everything might have to go through written discussions.


==== The people involved need to see how the agreement fits into the bigger picture ====

Although it's great for the team members to remove roadblocks that they run into on their day-2-day life, it's even more important for everyone to see the bigger picture. That way all the initiatives within the organisation can be aligned to achieve bigger outcomes.

"The collective outcomes are bigger than the sum of the individual parts."

==== It needs to solve a problem, remove a roadblock or seize an opportunity ====

The purpose of process improvements are increasing quality and productivity. All initiatives therefore need to tie
 into that. 


==== Document the decision thoroughly ====


Let’s face it: There are not a lot of people who like to write documentation in the IT industry. Let alone write standards. So documenting the rationale behind standards is probably way down on the list of priorities.

However, this is probably the most important thing in process improvements!

The most likely reason why people are not following standards is that they either don’t know that they exist (Cannot find the current one between all the stale ones in the intranet, multiple documents, very different content, same name and version, do these situations sound familiar? ) or the end user doesn’t agree with the standard. 

The first reason can be solved by following the recommendations in Chapter 11, “Standards Library” and training people in how to find the library. Preferably everyone who joins the organisation will be enrolled into the training and perhaps a mandatory periodic refresher?

The second is that the user of the standards doesn’t agree with the standard. This can be one of the following reasons:
  * The user doesn’t know all the angles that were considered when creating the standard.
  * The PIT that created the standard missed an argument that would have led to a different decision.
  * The user has a personal preference that differs from the consensus across the team that created the standard.
