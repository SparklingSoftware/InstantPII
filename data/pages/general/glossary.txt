==== Process Area ====

A Process Area is the scope to which a particular group is focussing on. "Requirements Gathering" is an example of a process area that clearly defined the scope. It's important to determine and articulate Process Areas, so the the people participating in the PII know who's responsible for what area.

The various groups within the PII. For instance: 
  * [[:general:glossary#SEPG| SEPG]]
  * [[:general:glossary#PIT| PIT]]
  * [[:general:glossary#MSG| MSG]]
  * [[:general:glossary#TWG| TWG]]
  * [[:general:glossary#Standards Team| Standards Team]]

==== Standard ====

It is really hard to define what a standard is, but here are a couple of examples of standards. 

  * Process maps
  * Role descriptions
  * Templates
  * Job aids
  * Tools selections
  * Link to external content

As you can see, the types are quite diverse, so the definition is pretty much: "Whatever the communities agree on".

==== Standards library ====

The library that contains the [[general:glossary#standard| Standards]]. This can be a wiki, portal or an entire custom build application. The main purpose is to maintain and publish the standards for consumption by everyone.
