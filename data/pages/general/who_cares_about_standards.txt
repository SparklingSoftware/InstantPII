===== Who care about standards? =====

I, for one, hate standards and especially ones that some governing body is making me follow! (I blame my Dutch background for that second part Btw. :-)). So why do it? Who cares and why?

**Because I hate inefficiencies even more and so do our customers!**

Our customer should be the end goal and their requirements are pretty simple when you drill into the basics: 
**I need software to be cheap and I need the best quality.** As any customer would! Don’t you when you are off to buy a car? Therefore it’s pretty save to take this as a baseline for further rationalisation.

So, two requirements:
  * Unordered List ItemQuality of the delivered software
  * Unordered List ItemProductivity (Rate of delivered requirements)

The SPII, with its organisation structure, the processes, the tools, reporting and all the rest needs to support the increase of Quality and/or productivity.
