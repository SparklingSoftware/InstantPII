==== Satellite Communities / SPII / SEPG ====

These are the communities that have implemented parts of "Share" and are using it to improve their software delivery processes. They can both be collaborating with the Global ALM Community to contribute to the Global ALM Standards Library, or they can download a local clone of the Global ALM Standards and tailor it for their own use without contributing back to the global community.

The communities can be within an organisation or across in the form of after-hour sessions for instance.

==== Standard ====

It is really hard to define what a standard is, but here are a couple of examples of standards. 

  * Process maps
  * Role descriptions
  * Templates
  * Job aids
  * Tools selections
  * Link to external content

As you can see, the types are quite diverse, so the definition is pretty much: "Whatever the communities agree on".
