===== Revision plans =====

With the introduction of adoption plans and periodically checking the adoption, it immediately begs the question: “How frequent”?
This brings us to one of the most important elements of the SPII: Preventing for standards to become stale.
The biggest sin that a standards library can commit is to let a standard go stale. It affects the whole library as the end user should be able to confidently grab a document from the library and know that it reflects the current thinking. 
Obviously this can never be 100% correct as it takes time for the organisation to react to changes. If a new version of a tool is released or if the company makes a new enterprise wide deal that changes the IT landscape, the SPII organisation has some work to do to make the standards reflect the latest agreed thinking. Nevertheless, a stale, up to date standards library is without a doubt the ideal scenario which should be tried to achieve.
The way to make sure this happens is to put a revision plan on each standard.
This document states all things related to periodically revising the standard. The most important thing it contains is the revision frequency, but also the actions that should be taken during a revision.
This plan is also in two parts, a base and a standard specific document. The base will state actions like actioning quality controls like:
  * Default revision frequency
  * Link checking
  * Checking for changes in referenced material (Names, newer version, abbreviations, etc).
  * Including the gathering of adoption numbers and comparing those with the adoption targets.
  * Branding (btw: Branding should include a year stamp, so that copies not directly from the standards library but from someone’s personal stash for example of hard copies are easily identified! Those documents are potentially out dated and this anti pattern should be discouraged. A year stamp is an easy and intuitive way to achieve this!)

The standard specific plan might contain for example:
  * Revision frequency (Will override the base frequency)
  * Other groups that need to check whether the information is still valid. (Sign off from the internal security group for instance, are all the security concerns still mitigated?)

The revision status should be reported or regular basis to the SEPG so that they action revisions as standards are up for revision.

What if the PIT doesn’t have the time / interest in revising the standard?

Well… That certainly raises an interesting discussion which can have only two outcomes:
  * Delete the standard from the library
  * Go back and find someone to revise it.

It’s as simple (and harsh) as that! But it’s needed in order to prevent the library to go stale. And also, it will make the SEPG answer the hard question: “Do we really want this standard?” The answer contributes to prevent documents for documents sake. The SEPG will become very aware of the maintenance cost for a standard.
