===== PIT (Group) =====

These are teams of software engineers that give part of their time to the process improvement, focusing on a specific process (for example, requirements' management process, project planning process, project tracking process, etc.). Every key process area should be allocated a 
Process Improvement Team (PIT) Each team takes responsibility and ownership of the improvement efforts of that of the key process areas.  Membership of each PIT would vary according to the nature and boundaries for the key process area. An example is  that membership of a â€œRequirements Management Process Improvement Team (RM-PIT) should include representatives of the customers, representatives of the project management, representatives of the subcontractors, representatives of the whole system of which the software is a component. 

The general responsibility of a PIT is implementing the software process improvement actions for the key process area allocated to the team. Specific activities could cover a wide variety of areas such as: 
  * Documentation, analysis and redesign of current processes.
  * Redesign of the processes under consideration.
  * Documenting the new processes.
  * Evaluating, selecting methods, techniques, and tools in support of the new processes (for example configuration management techniques and tools, design methods and tools, etc.). 
  * Developing and conducting process training.
  * Liaison with the SEPG to co-ordinate with related software PITs responsible for related key process areas. An example is co-ordination between the Configuration Management PIT and the Software Quality Assurance PIT to design common change control and review procedures). 
  * Designing procedures for monitoring the process performance, and specifying the feedback mechanisms that should be in place to collect feedback and the tools for analysis of the feedback data.
