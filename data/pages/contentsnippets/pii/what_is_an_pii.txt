A Software Process Improvement Infrastructure (SPII) is everything that enables organisations to efficiently improve their software processes. An SPII typically includes:
  * The workplaces to collaborate on improvements.
  * Progress tracking
  * Reporting, etc. 
  * The single location to store the latest [[general:glossary#job-aids|job-aids]].

Interestingly it's a good idea to start of with the basics as it's something that's easily missed! 
The purpose of process improvements is:
**Improving the way people work; Allowing them to be more productive and to increase the quality of their work.**

Making process improvements is NOT a matter of putting documents on the organisation intranet. Creating documents is NOT the end goal!

We are talking about changing the way people work (Which can potentially be described in a document). The best way however is to positively change the process without the need for documents. Because we are all busy, no one has the time to go through heaps of documents to fiogure out the correct process.

An SPII helps organisations make these process improvements. 

It involves:
  * The organisation structure/hierarchy to allow competency teams to endorse the improvements
  * The process to allow that to happen
  * The tools to support that process
  * Tools to enable efficient collaboration
  * reporting (Quality check across job-aids, prevention of stale standards)
  * Focus on adoption of job-aids, in stead of the urge to create more.
  * etc.

The most important thing to remember is that altough that there are many advantages to common approaches, sometime it's actually better to remove standards/job-aids. If they are not helping anyone, they are actually just in the way. And should therefore be removed. Don't be afriad to delete content and most of all, don't let anyone tie there ego to any of those artefacts!
