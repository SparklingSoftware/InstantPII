Get as much facts as possible before jumping into action. An increase of facts results in a decrease is room for discussion. There is an exception to this in case of contradicting facts, but that might be an indication that the organisation is not mature enough or that you might be dealing with multiple root causes. In any case, if you cannot manage to get the facts needed for a healthy discussion about improvements, than you should ask yourself whether you are on the right track.
The facts can be achieved in several ways, for instance:
  * Metrics out of systems (Automated, manual, one-off)
  * Customer feedback
  * Root cause analysis of production incidents over a period in the past
  * Project self-assessments 
  * Process Analysis
  * Voting / Survey
  * etc
Everyone needs to have access to these facts, so no one will be tempted to game them. Openness and honesty are the most important aspects.
