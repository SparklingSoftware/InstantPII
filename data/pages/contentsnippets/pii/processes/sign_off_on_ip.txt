During the next SEPG meeting the delivered artefacts get discussed. Depending on the size and/or impact of the IP, it can be good for morale to invite the people who have worked on the IP to talk about it for 5 or 10 minutes. Celebrating success is very important and it gives the ability for the SEPG to say “Thanks!!” to the participants!

After approval that decision also gets published again on the “Historical” workspace. The “SPII Admin” is responsible for this.
