In order to have informed conversations or debates, everyone needs to understand each other's background so that when someone makes a claim about priorities, the other participants can value the claim and understand why it's important. 

It also helps them weigh their own priorities against those of their colleagues and challenge their own or those from their peers.

To achieve this, the different roles, their tasks, etc. need to be defined so that everyone can understand their meaning. Especially those participants that are from other competencies.

This is harder than it seems and that's because every process area has their own set of abbreviations and language and people generally don't really care about other competencies.
