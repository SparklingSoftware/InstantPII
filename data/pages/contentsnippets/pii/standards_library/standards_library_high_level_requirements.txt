The standards library allows [[:general:roles#practitioner|practitioners]] to browse the available [[:general:glossary#standard|standards]]. As you can imagine, this is what the Global ALM Community is all about. Sharing and promoting the use of standards!

The innovating about the standards library as part of "Share", is that it allows to receive updates from the other communties, while allowing cusomisations to every [[:general:glossary#SatteliteStandardsLibrary|Sattelite standards library]]. It follows an open source model to allow contributing back to the overarching standards using out of the box notifications system.

Preferably the [[:general:roles#StandardsTeamMember|Standards team]] is not just responsible for the standards but also for the assistance in the adoption. The team should be reaching out in the organisation to work on the adoption of the standards. The website should therefore allow the practitioner to browse all available services of which "Providing Guidance and Standards" is just one.

Furthermore, the portal:
  * Should be implemented using a couple of mainstream CMS systems.
  * has the ability to apply branding through a naming convention of the images.
  * allows practitioners to find details of the standard, like rational, history, etc. So they understand why they should be using them.
  * learn how to apply the standard.

'1 Please note that the internal SPII plays only a little part in the whole system.
